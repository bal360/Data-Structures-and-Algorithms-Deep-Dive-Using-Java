# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Deep-Dive-Using-Java

I created this repository to show the different data structures and algorithms I am learning in the Udemy "Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java" course. 

**All of the algorithm implementations are the instructors, Sarah Ettritch, and NOT MY OWN.**

Any of the challenges that I complete will be in their own directories and clearly labeled to separate them from the instructors. Please keep in mind some of the challenges will simply be building off of the implementations laid out by the instructor.

I am primarily keeping this repository as a public record of my studies into data structures and algorithms.
